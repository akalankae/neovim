This directory contains configuration files that specify the user preferences.

NOTE: 
There is no satisfactory way to automatically source the files in this directory
without explicitly being sourced by $NVIM_CONFIG_DIR/init.lua 
Therefore, remember to add the name of each file to top-level init.lua at the
time a new user config file is added to this directory, or it will not be
sourced.
